A week ago, I was staring at a blank page for my first project in panic.  I had to create a whole project from scratch!! No more labs' step-by-step solution videos.  

I couldn’t give up just yet, so I started thinking about how to approach the project. The project asked to analyze sets of data with information about movies to help Microsoft decide how to go about their new journey into the movie industry.  I started by defining what makes a successful movie. The first answer that came to my mind was profit, of course, so I thought if I focus on profit only, it will be easier, simpler, and it won’t overwhelmed me too much. Well, it didn’t turn out quite that well, it wasn’t that simple, but the reward of completing the first project was worth all the challenges.

I used two datasets along with mostly pandas and matplotlib through which I was trying to answer questions such as; if other studios produce more of a certain genre, would that mean these genres are more profitable? I assumed that higher ratings, higher popularity, and a higher production budget would equal more revenue. Also, does the length of a movie have an effect on profit? The strongest correlation, as predicted, was found to be between production budget and profit. 

Even though I was able to clean the data and create plots to show results and answer these questions, I realized there’s a long road in front of me on my journey to becoming a real data scientist. But this is just the beginning and I’m ready for it!
